The Bike Sales Analysis Project analyzes a dataset containing information on 1000 people who have purchased bikes. The dashboard provides an overview of the dataset and allows users to filter the data based on their requirements. It includes sections on gender distribution, average income by gender, customer distance, age bracket, and a filter section. The project was performed in Microsoft Excel and provides a user-friendly way to analyze bike sales data. The dashboard can be further enhanced by including more variables and developing more advanced analytical tools.
