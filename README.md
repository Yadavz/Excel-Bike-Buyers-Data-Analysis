3.	Filter Section: The filter section allows users to filter the data based on their requirements. 

## Tools Used

I performed the analysis in Microsoft Excel and created the dashboard using Excel charts and graphs.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the bike sales dataset and provides a user-friendly dashboard to filter the data based on specific requirements. The project can be further enhanced by including more variables and developing more advanced analytical tools.
